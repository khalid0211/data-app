# 🔒 Admin Access Fix - Multiple Admins Support

## Issue
Users with 'admin' access level in database (like testuser@gmail.com) were not seeing admin-only menu items (Book Lending, User Management) even though the sidebar showed "Access: 🔒 Admin".

## Root Cause
The code was only checking the hardcoded admin email (khalid0211@gmail.com) to grant admin privileges:

```python
# Old code - only checked email
user_is_admin = is_admin(st.session_state.user_email)  # Only returns True for khalid0211@gmail.com
```

This meant that even if a user had `access_level: 'admin'` in the database, they wouldn't get admin features unless they were khalid0211@gmail.com.

## Solution
Updated the admin check to look at BOTH the hardcoded email AND the database access level:

```python
# New code - checks email OR database access level
user_is_admin = is_admin(st.session_state.user_email) or user_access_level == 'admin'
```

This allows:
1. **Primary Admin** (khalid0211@gmail.com) - Always admin regardless of database
2. **Additional Admins** - Any user with `access_level: 'admin'` in database

## Files Modified

### `app.py` - 3 locations updated

**1. Main menu building (line ~1195):**
```python
# Check if user is admin by email OR by access level in database
user_is_admin = is_admin(st.session_state.user_email) or user_access_level == 'admin'
```

**2. User Management page (line ~907):**
```python
# Check if admin (by email OR by access level)
if not (is_admin(st.session_state.user_email) or st.session_state.access_level == 'admin'):
    st.error("🚫 Access Denied - Admin only!")
    return
```

**3. Book Lending page (line ~1017):**
```python
# Check if admin (by email OR by access level)
if not (is_admin(st.session_state.user_email) or st.session_state.access_level == 'admin'):
    st.error("🚫 Access Denied - Admin only!")
    return
```

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Primary Admin (khalid0211@gmail.com)
- ✅ Always gets admin access (hardcoded)
- ✅ Even if database says 'manage' or 'view' (overridden by email check)
- ✅ Cannot be demoted by another admin

### Scenario 2: Additional Admin (e.g., testuser@gmail.com)
- ✅ Gets admin access if `access_level: 'admin'` in database
- ✅ Can be promoted/demoted by other admins
- ✅ Loses admin access if changed to 'manage' or 'view'

### Scenario 3: Manage User
- ✅ Can add/edit/delete books
- ❌ Cannot access Book Lending
- ❌ Cannot access User Management

### Scenario 4: View User
- ✅ Can view books
- ❌ Cannot add/edit/delete
- ❌ Cannot access admin features

## Admin Privileges

### What Admins Can Do:
- ✅ All Manage features (add, edit, delete books, bookshelves, owners)
- ✅ **Book Lending** - Lend/return books, view loan history
- ✅ **User Management** - Approve users, change access levels
- ✅ Grant admin access to other users
- ✅ Revoke admin access from other admins (except khalid0211@gmail.com)

### Menu Items (Admin):
1. 📚 View Books
2. ➕ Add Book
3. ✏️ Manage Books
4. 📚 Bookshelves
5. 👤 Owners
6. 📖 Book Lending ← Admin only
7. 👥 User Management ← Admin only
8. 👤 My Profile

**Total: 8 menu items**

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Grant Admin to Test User
1. Login as khalid0211@gmail.com
2. Go to **👥 User Management**
3. Find testuser@gmail.com
4. Change access level to **'admin'**
5. Click **💾 Update Access**
6. Test user logs out and back in
7. ✅ Should see 8 menu items
8. ✅ Should see "Book Lending"
9. ✅ Should see "User Management"
10. ✅ Sidebar shows "Access: 🔒 Admin"

### Test Case 2: Revoke Admin from Test User
1. Login as khalid0211@gmail.com
2. Go to **👥 User Management**
3. Find testuser@gmail.com
4. Change access level to **'manage'**
5. Click **💾 Update Access**
6. Test user refreshes page
7. ✅ Menu items reduced to 6
8. ✅ "Book Lending" removed
9. ✅ "User Management" removed
10. ✅ Sidebar shows "Access: ✏️ Manage"

### Test Case 3: Admin Can Manage Other Admins
1. Login as testuser@gmail.com (admin)
2. Go to **👥 User Management**
3. Find another user
4. Change to **'admin'**
5. ✅ Successfully creates another admin
6. ✅ New admin gets all privileges

### Test Case 4: Primary Admin Cannot Be Demoted
1. Login as testuser@gmail.com (admin)
2. Go to **👥 User Management**
3. Find khalid0211@gmail.com
4. Try to change to **'manage'** or **'view'**
5. Click **💾 Update Access**
6. ✅ Database updates BUT...
7. khalid0211@gmail.com still has admin access (hardcoded)
8. ℹ️ This is by design - primary admin always has access

## Security Notes

### Primary Admin Protection
- khalid0211@gmail.com is hardcoded in `utils/auth_utils.py`
- Cannot be demoted or removed
- Always has admin access regardless of database
- This ensures at least one admin always exists

### Multiple Admins
- System supports multiple admins
- All admins have equal privileges (except primary admin protection)
- Admins can promote/demote each other
- Admins should be trusted users only

### Best Practices
1. Grant admin access sparingly
2. Use 'manage' for power users who don't need user management
3. Use 'view' for read-only users
4. Regularly audit admin users
5. Keep khalid0211@gmail.com as primary admin

## Migration from Old System

### If You Had Multiple Admins Before
Previously, you might have given multiple users "full" access expecting them to manage users. Now:

1. Those users have 'manage' access (after migration)
2. They can add/edit/delete books
3. They CANNOT manage users or lend books
4. Promote them to 'admin' if they need those features

### Steps to Promote:
1. Login as khalid0211@gmail.com
2. Go to User Management
3. Filter by "Manage"
4. For each user who should be admin:
   - Change dropdown to 'admin'
   - Click Update Access
5. They now have full admin privileges

## Status
✅ **Fixed** - Multiple admins now supported
✅ **Tested** - Primary and secondary admins both work
✅ **Backward Compatible** - Existing system unchanged
