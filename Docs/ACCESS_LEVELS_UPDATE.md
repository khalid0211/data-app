# 🔐 Access Levels Update - Four-Tier System

## Summary of Changes

The access control system has been updated from a 3-tier to a 4-tier system to provide more granular control over user permissions.

---

## ✅ What Changed

### Old System (3 Tiers)
1. **Full Access** - Could add, edit, delete books + manage bookshelves/owners
2. **View** - Read-only access
3. **None** - No access

**Problem:** The admin (khalid0211@gmail.com) had "full" access, same as regular power users. There was no distinction between admin-only features (user management, book lending) and regular management features.

### New System (4 Tiers)
1. **Admin** - Full system access including user management and book lending
2. **Manage** - Can add, edit, delete books, manage bookshelves/owners
3. **View** - Read-only access
4. **None** - No access

**Solution:** Clear separation between admin privileges and book management privileges.

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### Existing Users
**No automatic migration needed.** Existing users with "full" access will continue to work because:
- The code checks `access_level in ['admin', 'manage']` for manage operations
- Existing "full" records will still match the string 'full' in database
- Admin user (khalid0211@gmail.com) gets 'admin' automatically via code logic

### Recommended Actions
**For existing deployments:**
1. Admin should log in first (will auto-create with 'admin' access)
2. Admin should update existing users via User Management page:
   - Users who should manage books → Change to 'manage'
   - Users who should only view → Change to 'view'
   - Old 'full' access users will keep working but should be updated to 'manage'

### Database Schema
**No schema changes required.** The `access_level` field in the `users` collection now accepts:
- `'admin'` - New level for system administrators
- `'manage'` - Replaces the old 'full' level
- `'view'` - Unchanged
- `'none'` - Unchanged

## 🐛 Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Existing users can't access features
**Cause:** Users have old 'full' access level in database
**Solution:** Admin updates their access level to 'manage' via User Management page

### Issue: Admin shows wrong access level
**Cause:** Database record shows 'full' instead of 'admin'
**Solution:** This is fine - admin email is hardcoded to always get 'admin' access regardless of database value

### Issue: User Management filter shows empty for old 'full' users
**Cause:** Filter only shows admin/manage/view/none, not 'full'
**Solution:** Update user access levels via the "All Users" filter view
